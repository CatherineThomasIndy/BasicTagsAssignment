    <h1>Betta Fish Facts</h1>
    <h4>Scientific name: <i>Betta Splendens</i></h4>
    <hr />
    <p>Betta splendens, also called "Siamese fighting fish," is a freshwater fish native to Southeast Asia. They are known primarily for their beautiful appearance and their
    territorial aggression. 
    <br>Unlike most fish, bettas have what is called a "labyrinth organ," which is an organ that allows bettas to go to the surface of the water and draw in
    oxygen straight from the air! This means that 
    <br>bettas can actually tolerate low oxygen levels in the water, and is likely an adaptation due to their environment - their
    preferred natural habitat is a still, shallow pond with lots of plant coverage.</p>
